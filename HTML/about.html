        <p>

          accessible, intuitive, and creative web experiences that make people’s

        <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
        <p>
          My main goal is to improve my problem-solving ability, write cleaner
          and more efficient code, and learn how to collaborate effectively with
          other developers on real-world projects.

        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          I sometimes feel less confident when working on large-scale backend
          systems or advanced algorithms, but I’m actively learning and
          improving through consistent practice.

        <p>
          Keep experimenting, keep learning, and don’t be afraid of mistakes —
          every challenge you face will sharpen your skills and shape your
          journey.

        <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          I’m excited about the opportunities technology brings to connect
          people and solve problems creatively. Collaboration and learning from
          others remain my biggest motivators.
